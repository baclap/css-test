# CSS Coding Test

My submission for the CSS portion of the coding test requested by StackCommerce.

Instructions: https://github.com/stacksocial/code-challenge/tree/master/frontend/css-01

I setup a livereload server along with a node static server to allow me to quickly work through this test. I also setup a gulpfile to watch my LESS files and compile them when changes were detected.

Dev Instructions:
- requires node and gulp
- `npm install`
- `gulp`
- `node server` (http://localhost:3000 - use with livereload Chrome extension)
